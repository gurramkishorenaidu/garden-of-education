        How AMS Teaches Class 4 English
      </p>
      <p className="text-normal pt-8">
        At the primary level, knowledge of grammar is to be seen mainly as a
        process of discovering uses and functions of items through exposure to
        spoken and written inputs. Reading, writing, and spoken English for
        Class 4 is practiced daily during our Online Classes. Highly trained
        tutors for Class 4 English use tools like comprehensive worksheets, and
        study material such as live quizzes, daily revision, assignments, tests
        and tuition to help keep students of Class 4 sharp, alert and attentive
        covering boards such as CBSE and State Board. These also help them build
        their vocabulary, improve their fluency, and improve their understanding
        of the subject. In general, vocabulary development through reading
        extensively with comprehension and interest and writing activities of a
        higher order than hitherto developed are the main goals of
        teaching/learning at this stage.
